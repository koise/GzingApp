# 🔧 FIX USER PHONE NUMBER ISSUE

## 🚨 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

### **Error from Server:**
```json
{"success":false,"message":"User phone number is missing for ID: 37"}
```

### **Root Cause:**
User ID 37 exists in the database but doesn't have a phone number (`phone_number` field is NULL or empty).

## ✅ **GOOD NEWS: SERVER IS WORKING!**

The database column fix is working perfectly:
- ✅ Server is using `phone_number` column correctly
- ✅ Real user data fetching is working
- ✅ No more database column errors
- ✅ SMS service is functional

## 🔧 **SOLUTION OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Add Phone Number to User Record**
Update the user record in the database:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET phone_number = '+639171234567' 
WHERE id = 37;
```

### **Option 2: Use Different User ID**
Test with a user that has a phone number:
```json
{
  "contacts": ["+639934469840"],
  "emergency_type": "emergency",
  "latitude": 0.0,
  "longitude": 0.0,
  "message": "GPS location unavailable. Please check my last known location or contact me directly.",
  "user_id": 1
}
```

### **Option 3: Check Available Users**
Query the database to find users with phone numbers:
```sql
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, phone_number 
FROM users 
WHERE phone_number IS NOT NULL 
AND phone_number != '' 
LIMIT 5;
```

## 🧪 **TEST WITH DIFFERENT USER ID**

Try testing with user ID 1 or another user that has a phone number:

```bash
curl -X POST https://powderblue-pig-261057.hostingersite.com/mobile-api/sms/send_emergency_sms \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "contacts": ["+639934469840"],
  "emergency_type": "emergency",
  "latitude": 0.0,
  "longitude": 0.0,
  "message": "Test emergency",
  "user_id": 1
}'
```
