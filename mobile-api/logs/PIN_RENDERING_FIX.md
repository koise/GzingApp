# ðŸ”´ Pin Rendering Fix - Circle Markers

## ðŸ”§ **Issue Identified**
**Problem**: Polylines were drawing correctly, but pins weren't appearing on the map
**Root Cause**: The Mapbox marker icon "marker-15" was not available in the current Mapbox style

## âœ… **Solution Implemented**

### **Changed from Symbol Layer to Circle Layer**
Instead of using icon-based markers, I switched to circle layers which are more reliable and don't depend on specific icon availability.

### **New Pin Implementation**
```kotlin
// Add pins layer using circles
style.addLayer(
    circleLayer("route-pins-layer", "route-pins") {
        circleRadius(8.0)
        circleColor("#FF0000")
        circleStrokeColor("#FFFFFF")
        circleStrokeWidth(2.0)
    }
)
```

### **Pin Appearance**
- **Shape**: Red circles with white borders
- **Size**: 8.0 pixel radius
- **Color**: Red (#FF0000) fill
- **Border**: White (#FFFFFF) stroke, 2.0 pixel width
- **Position**: Exact coordinates from API

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

Now when you run the app and select a route, you should see:

1. âœ… **Red circles** appear at each pin location
2. âœ… **White borders** around each circle for better visibility
3. âœ… **Red route lines** connecting all the circles
4. âœ… **Map camera fits** to show the entire route

### **Visual Appearance**
- **Pins**: Red circles with white borders (8px radius)
- **Route Line**: Red line (4px width, 80% opacity)
- **Combined**: Clear, visible route with distinct markers

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Testing**

The fix is complete and the build is successful! The pins should now be visible as red circles with white borders on the map.

### **Console Output Expected:**
```
D/RoutesActivity: Adding 2 pins for route: Evson Baccay
D/RoutesActivity: Successfully added 2 pins to map
D/RoutesActivity: Adding route polyline for route: Evson Baccay
D/RoutesActivity: Successfully added route polyline with 23 points
D/RoutesActivity: Fitted camera to route bounds - Center: 14.582236, 121.151313, Zoom: 14.0
```

**Both pins and polylines should now be visible!** ðŸŽ‰
